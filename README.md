- **Express-Session**: for session management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Google Developer account.

### Steps to Set Up Google OAuth Authentication

1. Go to the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Select your project (or create a new one).
3. Navigate to **APIs & Services** > **Credentials**.
4. Configure the OAuth Consent Screen:
   - In the left sidebar, navigate to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen.
   - Choose User Type:
     External → your app will be used by users outside your organization (public app).
   - Fill in the Consent Screen Details.
   - On the Scopes screen, click Add or Remove Scopes.
     Choose the required scopes (.../auth/userinfo.email,.../auth/userinfo.profile,openid).
5. Click on **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth Client ID**.
   - Choose Application Type: Web Application (for web apps).
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Wecode").
   - Under Authorized redirect URIs, add:
     `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
`
   - Click create.
   - After creation, you'll see your Client ID and Client Secret. Copy and store them securely.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:WeCode-Community-Dev/wecode-web.git
   cd wecode-web

   ```

2. **Creating a New Branch from a Parent Branch**
   ```bash
   # Switch to the parent branch
   git checkout dev

   # Pull the latest changes

   git pull origin dev

   # Create a new branch

   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:** Create a .env file in backend folder and add the following variable:

```bash
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/Wecode
NODE_ENV=development
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

5. **Install frontend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

6. **Set up environment variables:** Create a .env file in frontend folder and add the following variable:

```bash
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Running the application

1.  **Start the frontend server :**

    - Open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory, and run


        ```bash

    npm run dev

    ```
    This command starts a local development server. By default, it runs on http://localhost:5173, where you can view the application in your browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the page.

    ```

2.  **Build the frontend project for production:**

        ```bash

    npm run build

    ```
    This command generates an optimised production build in the dist folder. The build is minified and includes all necessary assets for deployment.

    ```

3.  **Start the backend server :**

    - Open a terminal and navigate to the backend directory, then run:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

    ```

4.  **Build the backend project for production:**

```bash
  npm run build
  npm run serve
```
